# Rewards-Reference-Domain

This project is a part of the Spring Academy learning path, where I am exploring and applying concepts related to building a Rewards Application with Spring Boot.

## Project Overview

The Rewards Application works like a "Frequent Flyer" program but for restaurants. It helps customers save money when they eat at specific restaurants. The app rewards users for dining, and the saved money is shared among the people linked to the account.

## Project Structure

## TODO List

The project includes a TODO list that outlines areas for improvement, additions, and code modifications.

### Example TODOs:

- TODO-07: Write code here for rewarding an account according to the sequence diagram in the lab document
- TODO-08: Return the corresponding reward confirmation
- TODO-17 (Optional): Create custom AuthenticationProvider.
    Note that it needs to implement AuthenticationProvider interface.
      Uncomment the commented code fragment below so that this custom.
        AuthenticationProvider handles a user with the following credentials
- TODO-18a (Optional): Add authentication based upon the custom AuthenticationProvider

## Future Enhancements

Future commits will involve addressing the TODO list, incorporating concepts learned from the Spring Academy learning path.
